## About the Project
Generative Adversarial Networks, or GAN, is a class of machine learning systems where two neural networks contest with each other. A model called the Generator is trained on real images which then generate new images that look at least superficially authentic to human observers while another model called the Discriminator distinguishes images produced by the Generator from real images. In this project, I aim to build a GAN using the MNIST dataset to generate fake MNIST images. For more on GAN, please visit: <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf"><strong>Ian Goodfellow's GAN paper</strong></a>.
